### Employee Sleep Health Tracker

Workplace Wellness is a web application for tracking and improving company-wide sleep health both for employees and employers. Users can input daily sleep and health metrics (eg., sleep duration, blood pressure, stress level) and view past reports or check out recommended strategies for improving their sleep health. Admins get a bird's eye view of the entire company's sleep health and can add or delete users as employees come and go from the company.

This project was originally developed as a team project for the Chegg Skills Winter '24 Hackathon. The team was comprised of three software engineers, a UI/UX designer, a data analyst, and a senior advisor. The repo you are looking at is the product of two of the team engineers' later efforts to re-engineer the codebase with an emphasis on refactoring and modernizing the UI/UX.

The original hackathon submission can be found here: https://github.com/EngineerPehr/winter_24_hackathon
